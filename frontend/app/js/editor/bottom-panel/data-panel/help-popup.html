                In the scope of a page, form, or layout, a variable or action can be used to handle business data,
                or can contain structural information that determines how page elements behave.
            </p>

            <p translate>Using the variable or action in a widget property depends on the property value
                type, described in the page editor general help, in the <i>Properties</i> section.</p>

            <p translate>Available variables types are string, JSON, and URL parameter. Available action types are JavaScript
                expression, External API, and Business data.</p>

            <p translate>You can extend our REST API capacities by creating <em>REST API extensions</em> in the Studio
                <i>Development</i> menu and use them as External API variables in the UI Designer.</p>

        <uib-tab heading="{{ 'Living data' | translate }}">
            <p translate>Variables or actions can be bound to input fields to create conditional behavior between widget
                properties.</p>

            <p translate>A binding is dynamic, so every time data changes, all variables or actions are re-evaluated and the
                UI is updated. In consequence:</p>
            <ul>
                <li translate>An action initialized with a JavaScript expression is executed when the page is loaded. Then, when
                    one of its dependencies changes, its value is updated. Dependencies are created using <code>$data.XXX</code>.
                </li>
                <li translate>An action initialized with an External API is reloaded every time the URL value changes.</li>
                <li translate>A Business data action is reloaded every time the filter value changes.</li>
            </ul>

            <p translate>
                When you generate a form from a contract in the Studio, the form contains a Submit button and some
                default variables and actions: <code>formInput</code>,
                <code>formOutput</code>, <code>taskId</code>, and <code>context</code>
            </p>

            <p translate>
                <code>formInput</code> is a JSON object.
                <br/>Its structure is defined by the contract inputs and the attributes are initialized with default
                values. It could be used to set initial
                values for form fields.
                <br/>You can set the values in <code>formInput</code> either by editing the default values with
                constants (useful for test and debug) or with
                values from an object in an external source that has the same model (such as with a BDM external API).
                <br/>You can also set the initial values of a form from some other source without using
                <code>formInput</code>. However, you will then have to
                edit <code>formOutput</code> manually.
            </p>

            <p translate>
                <code>formOutput</code> is a JavaScript expression returning an object.
                <br/>Its structure matches the contract requirements and is filled with <code>formInput</code> by
                default. Its goal is to aggregate the fields
                from the form and to submit them to the task or process to fulfil the contract. On Submit, values
                entered or modified by the end-user and
                aggregated in the <code>formOutput</code> object (as defined by the <i>Data sent on click</i> property
                of the Submit button) are submitted to
                the process or task
            </p>

            <p translate>
                <code>taskId</code> is a URL Parameter.
                <br/>It is the id of the current BPM task. You can use it as a BPM API parameter.
            </p>

            <p><translate><code>context</code> is an External API.</translate>
                <br/><translate>It provides references to all business variables and documents in the process instance (case).
                To retrieve a business variable instance, create an External API action with value</translate> <span
                ng-non-bindable>../{{context.myBusinessData_ref.link}}</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <translate>To retrieve a document instance, create an External API action with value</translate> <span
                ng-non-bindable>../API/{{context.documentData_ref.url}}</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <translate>To allow your user to download a document add a link widget with its url property bound to</translate><span
                ng-non-bindable>'../API/' + context.documentData_ref.url</span>
            </p>
			<p translate>
                <code>submit_errors_list</code> is a JavaScript expression formatting the response payload to html when a submit fails.
            </p>
			<p translate>
				In some cases, other types of variables are created:
				<ul>
					<li> When the business variable is edited in the form (as specified in the contract creation wizard), a UI Designer action is created for each variable (External API).
					<br/>For example, if the contract input has been created from a business variable 'invoice' in the process, an action <code>invoice</code> is created in the form and its URL is set to <span
                ng-non-bindable>../{{context.invoice_ref.link}}</span>.
					<br/>If <code>invoice</code> contains lazy relations, additional actions are generated for each lazy relation to resolve (using <em>lazyRef</em> filter).
					<br/>For example, if 'invoice' has a 'customer' relation in lazy, an External API action <code>invoice_customer</code> is added. Its URL is set to <span
                ng-non-bindable>{{invoice|lazyRef:'customer'}}</span>.</li>
					<li>To display an aggregated object, a Select widget is generated to display the <em>available values</em> of the object. The action (External API) bound to the widget is created. It queries the BDM.
					<br/>For example, when the object Invoice has an aggregated object Customer, an action <code>customer_query</code> is created with URL: <span
                ng-non-bindable>../API/bdm/businessData/com.company.model.Customer?q=find&p=0&c=99</span>. By default it uses the <code>find</code> query with a default pagination (only first 100 objects are returned).</li>
